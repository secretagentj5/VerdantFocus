## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calming green (#8FBC8F) for the timer ring, buttons, and highlights, evoking a sense of focus and nature.
- Accent color: Pleasant soft green (#90EE90) for the break timer ring and secondary highlights. This color helps to promote calm, and because it is analogous to the primary color it prevents visual harshness.
- Background color: Very light, airy, off-white (#F0FFF0) to maintain a clean and uncluttered feel. As it has some desaturated green hue in it, it coordinates well with the other colors.
- Overall layout should be spacious, clean, and modern with cards with rounded corners and soft shadows.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for all text to maintain a clean, modern, and highly readable interface. This font is well-suited to UIs and long-form text, so it is useful throughout the app.
- Use simple, minimalist, and universally understood icons (e.g., a play icon, a pause icon, a coffee cup for breaks, a checkmark for completion).

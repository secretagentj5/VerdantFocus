# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how VerdantFocus handles your information.

## Information Collection

VerdantFocus is a client-side application and does not collect any personal data. All user data, such as tasks and settings, is stored locally within your browser and is not transmitted to any server.

## Information Use

Since no personal data is collected, information is not used for any purpose other than the core functionality of the application (managing tasks and timer settings).

## Information Sharing

No information is shared with third parties.

## Data Security

User data is stored locally in your browser's storage. While steps are taken to ensure the integrity of this local data, it is important to be aware that local browser storage is not as secure as server-side storage.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
